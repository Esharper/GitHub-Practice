1. Why is source control, especially Git, important for software development? Explain the problems that source control systems like Git help solve and the benefits they offer.

It is important because you can go into the background and log your whole process and go back and where finish work is still a rough draft.

2. How do local and remote repositories differ, and why is synchronization between them essential when working with Git? Provide a clear understanding of these two aspects of Git.

Local reopsitories will only make local changes. Remote repositories are done using a server so it can be done with class mates.
